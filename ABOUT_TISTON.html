		<font size="4" color="#21618C">
		It is nice to see you here in my website!<br>
		<br>
		First, I want to introduce my self to you, I'm Nikkie Tiston.<br>
		I am 16 years old right now. My birth date is October 01, 2006.
		I am highschool student, a grade ten(10). This is personal website that I made for my TLE subject.<br>
		I am an extrovert. I will not stop talking if we're close. Some of my friends are telling that I am humorous because
		I always crack jokes<br>
		and make them laugh. I stan Kpop, especially Blackpink girl group. I don't have bias because
		I love four of them equally.<br>
		I hope on March 25 or 26, I can go to their concert.<br>
		<br>
		I want to share my favorite subject and my favorite is recess. Kidding aside, my favorite subject is math,
		I love solving and make myself stress because of the sulotuion. I find math interesting, especially when
		we talked about math that involse money.<br> I don't know what strand  I should take this coming senior high.
		I am still undesided if I should take ABM or STEM. I don't know what should I do to my life.<br>
		<br>
		
		That's all I can share to you guys. If you want to know more about me,<br>
		you can visit the gallery up there for you to see some of my photo and video. 
		You can also click the contact and visit my social medias.
